# **Overview**

A comprehensive data clustering web application that helps you analyze your datasets using various clustering algorithms. This system makes it easy to explore patterns in your data, evaluate clustering quality, and generate insightful reportsâ€”all through a user-friendly interface.


## **What This App Does**

- Apply Multiple Clustering Algorithms: Run K-Means, DBSCAN, HDBSCAN, Gaussian Mixture Models, or Hierarchical Clustering on your data

- Evaluate Results: Get detailed metrics like silhouette score and Davies-Bouldin index to understand your clustering quality


## **Getting Started**

### **Quick Start**

**Clone the repository:**

git clone https://github.com/sids30/clustering-chat-systems.git

cd clustering-chat-systems


**Install the required packages:**

pip install -r requirements.txt


**Run the application:**

python main.py


**Open your browser and go to:**

http://localhost:8000


## **Using the Web Interface**

**Upload Your Data:**

- Click the "Upload" button on the home page

- Select your CSV or Excel file

- Wait for confirmation that your file has been uploaded


**Choose an Algorithm:**

- Select one of the available clustering algorithms from the dropdown menu

- Each algorithm has different strengths depending on your data characteristics


**Configure Parameters:**

- Set algorithm-specific parameters or use the default values

- For beginners, the default parameters work well for most datasets


**Run Clustering:**

- Click the "Run Clustering" button

- The system will process your data and apply the selected algorithm

- You'll see a progress indicator while the job runs


**View Results:**

- Once complete, you'll see a summary of your clustering results

- The results include the number of clusters, distribution of data points, and quality metrics


**Note:** The parameter optimization, report generation, and AI assistance features mentioned in the code are currently under development and not yet functional in the application.


## **Example Use Cases**

- Customer Segmentation: Group customers based on purchasing behavior

- Document Classification: Organize documents by topic or content similarity
  
- Anomaly Detection: Identify unusual patterns or outliers in your data
  
- Image Grouping: Cluster images based on visual features
  
- Geographic Analysis: Group locations based on proximity or other attributes

## **Supported Algorithms**

The application currently supports these clustering algorithms:
- K-Means
  
- DBSCAN
  
- HDBSCAN
  
- Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)
  
- Agglomerative (Hierarchical)
